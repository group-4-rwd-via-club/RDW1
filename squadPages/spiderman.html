                        <div class="text">In Forest Hills, Queens, New York, Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. As child, he is bitten by a radioactive spider at a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid". Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star. However, he blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, and his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben. Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, "With great power -  comes great responsibility!"</div>
                            
                        <div class="text">Despite his superpowers, Parker struggles to help his widowed aunt pay rent and he is also taunted by his peers â€” particularly football star Flash. As he battles his enemies for the first time Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult. In time Peter graduates from high school and enrolls at Empire State University where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and girlfriend Gwen Stacy. As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems - Harry's father is revealed to be Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin. Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus.</div>
