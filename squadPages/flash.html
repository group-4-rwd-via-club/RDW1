                        <div class="text">Barry Allen is a forensic chemist with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc√©e, Iris West, as the result of being absent-minded and his devotion to crime-solving. One night, as he is working late, a lightning bolt shatters a case full of chemicals and spills all over Barry. As a result, Allen finds that he can run extremely fast and has matching reflexes and senses. He dons a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt, dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, Jay Garrick), and becomes Central City's resident costumed crimefighter. Central City University professor Ira West (Iris' adoptive father) designed Allen's costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity.[2] The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invented the cosmic treadmill, a device that allowed for precise time travel. Allen was so well liked that nearly all squad members are often compared to him. Even thoug the Flash reguarly taunts Spider-man, Batman once said "Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered."</div>
